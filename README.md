W5x00 ethernet library for STM32F103 micro-controllers
----

That library has been ported from the **WIZnet WIZ_Ethernet_Library**, to STM32F103 microcontrollers.
The library supports **W5100** and **W5500** Ethernet controllers. The source code has been modified to support the **W5200** too, but has not been tested (yet) on a real W5200 controller.

Ported to STM32F103 on 23 Aug 2015 by **Vassilis Serasidis**

Library installation
----
### *Instal the library globally* ###


* Unzip the file **Ethernet_STM-master.zip** into your Arduino IDE directory 
> arduino\libraries

and rename the folder **Ethernet_STM-master** to **Ethernet_STM**

#### *Install the library for using it only with STM32F1 series* ###
 
* Unzip the file **Ethernet_STM-master.zip** into your Arduino IDE directory 
> ...arduino\hardware\Arduino_STM32\STM32F1\libraries

and rename the folder **Ethernet_STM-master** to **Ethernet_STM**


Selecting the Ethernet type controller (W5100, W5200 or W5500)
----
For selecting among those tree chips edit the file:
`Ethernet_STM\src\utility\w5100.h`
and comment-out only the line with the chip you want to use.

By default the **W5500** ethernet chip is selected.

```
//#define W5100_ETHERNET_SHIELD // Arduino Ethenret Shield and Compatibles ...
//#define W5200_ETHERNET_SHIELD // WIZ820io, W5200 Ethernet Shield 
#define W5500_ETHERNET_SHIELD   // WIZ550io, ioShield series of WIZnet
```
If you edit the **w5100.h** file, save it and re-compile your sketch. 

Using the Ethernet_STM library
----
1. Choose the desired ethernet chip you want to use (W5100, W5200 or W5500) from the w5100.h file
2. include in your sketch this library 

`#include <Ethernet_STM.h>`

The same functions / commands are the same as the stock Arduino Ethernet library.
